# Cheatsheets

My normal inclination when I learn a trick — a command, bit of code, etc — is to lock it away behind some abstraction so that I can stop thinking about it. A Bash function, a Rust function, whatever. I think that impacts my ability to use services and concepts effectively.

I'm compiling here some of these tricks as I find them so that I can do sort of a flashcard approach. Often, just knowing a command and a subcommand is probably enough to find the rest of the answer for myself interactively rather than through tab-completing a function name, etc.
